# My Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal configuration files (dotfiles) for setting up a minimal shell environment. The configurations are tailored for a clean and efficient shell experience, with Zsh leveraging the `powerlevel9k` theme for a visually appealing and informative prompt.

## Overview

This repository includes:

- **Bash Configuration**:
  - `.bashrc`: Custom Bash configurations including aliases, prompt customization, and basic environment settings.
- **Zsh Configuration**:
  - `.zshrc`: Minimal Zsh configuration using the `powerlevel9k` theme for prompt customization.
  - `.p10k.zsh`: Configuration file for `powerlevel9k` (or `powerlevel10k`).

## Directory Structure

├── .p10k.zsh       # powerlevel9k/powerlevel10k theme configuration
└── README.md       # This file
```

## Features

### Bash Configuration (`.bashrc`)

- **Aliases**: Commonly used command shortcuts for convenience.
- **Prompt Customization**: A simple and informative prompt displaying the current directory and user.
- **Environment Settings**: Basic environment variable settings for a clean shell experience.

### Zsh Configuration (`.zshrc`)

- **Powerlevel9k Theme**: Leverages the `powerlevel9k` theme for a powerful and customizable prompt.
- **Minimal Plugins**: Only essential plugins are loaded to keep the shell lightweight.
- **Prompt Customization**: A visually appealing prompt with useful information, including git status, current directory, and user info.
- **Path Setup**: Ensures the correct paths are added to `$PATH` for easy command execution.

## Installation

To set up these dotfiles on your system, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
```

### 2. Symlink the Dotfiles

Symlink the `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, and `.p10k.zsh` files to your home directory depending on the shell you are using:

```bash
# For Bash
ln -sf ~/dotfiles/.bashrc ~/.bashrc

# For Zsh
ln -sf ~/dotfiles/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
ln -sf ~/dotfiles/.p10k.zsh ~/.p10k.zsh
```

### 3. Install Powerlevel9k or Powerlevel10k

To use the `powerlevel9k` theme, you need to install it (or `powerlevel10k`, which is a faster and more feature-rich version):

```bash
# If using Oh My Zsh:
git clone https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel9k

# For powerlevel10k (recommended):
git clone https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k
```

### 4. Reload the Shell

After symlinking, reload your shell to apply the new configuration:

```bash
# For Bash
source ~/.bashrc

# For Zsh
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Customization

Feel free to customize the configurations to fit your needs. The provided configurations are designed to be minimal, making it easy to add your own aliases, functions, or environment settings.

### Customizing Powerlevel9k/Powerlevel10k

If you're using `powerlevel10k`, run the configuration wizard to customize your prompt:

```bash
p10k configure
```

You can edit the `.p10k.zsh` file directly to customize the prompt further.

### Adding Aliases

To add your own aliases, simply edit the `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:

```bash
# Example alias in .bashrc or .zshrc
alias gs='git status'
```
